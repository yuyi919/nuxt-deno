# Nuxt with Deno KV

A collaborative todo-list app built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) with server-side rendering on the edge on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and [Deno KV](https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual) as database.

Demo: https://yuyi-nuxt-deno-19.deno.dev

It also leverages [Deno KV Watch](https://deno.com/blog/kv-watch) and Server-Sent Events to update the UI in real-time for a shared todo list.

## Deploy on Deno Deploy

You can take a look at the [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file to see how the deployment is done.

To build the demo in production, you need a [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro) license, if you don't want to use UI Pro, you can remove the `@nuxt/ui-pro` from the dependencies abd `nuxt.config.ts`.

Otherwise, you can set the `NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE` secret in your GitHub repository settings.
